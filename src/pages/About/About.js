                            RATEMYMD was created as a result of a traumatic experience 
                            that I went through in the Emergency Room of a hospital. The 
                            memory of me laying on the floor pleading and crying for help 
                            while nurses laughed, told patients that I was faking my 
                            symptoms and that if I didn't stop they would Baker Act me. 
                            At one point a nurse closed the curtains in the area I was in 
                            because I was making too much noise. The helplessness I felt 
                            on that day I would not wish upon my worst enemy. Many people 
                            would assume that this is a isolated incident but this is a 
                            common occurance in the black community.

                            From rich to poor black mothers are not listened to when they 
                            report signs of possible complications during pregnancy and birth. 
                            Not only, are their concerns dismissed, but traumatic birthing 
                            experiences are so common that one - quarter of black women report 
                            disrespect and abuse from medical professionals in the hospital. 
                            New York's Department of Health has found that black women are three 
                            times more likely to die from pregnancy - related complications than 
                            white women, and this disparity persisted even when college - 
                            educated black women were compared with non - black women who did 
                            not finish high school.

                            My contribution to combating this racial disparity is by creating 
                            RATEMYMD. A web application developed to give a voice to the voiceless. 
                            With this app visitors are able to comment and rate their hospital, 
                            doctors and nurses be it positive or negative mistreatment by hospital 
                            staff. A nation's greatness is measured by how it treats it's weakest 
                            member and as of right now America is falling horribly.
